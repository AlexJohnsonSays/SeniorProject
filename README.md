# SeniorProject
Math. Senior Project of Alex Olsen

Made to help students with their math homework.

  For my senior project, I plan on creating a program that will solve equations a student inputs. This will be used as a study help, and therefore will not give an answer. Instead the student will be given an 'correct' or 'incorrect' to prevent the program from being usd as an answer key. If a student gives an incorrect answer, two options will be presented: Retry and Example. Retry will send them back to the problem they have given to make sure it is presented correctly. Example will show them a premade example of a similar problem.

  This program will help students study for tests. It will be free, open source, and open to the public. I hope to expand my knowledge of programming in general.
